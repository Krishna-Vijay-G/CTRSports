/**
 * One deployment, two front doors.
 *
 * Every request is answered by the same build, the same process and the same
 * database connection. What the hostname decides is which of the two
 * applications in this repo is reachable:
 *
 *   the admin host     the admin, at its own root: /, /landing, /incrc, /login
 *   every other host   the public site, and nothing else
 *
 * Which hostnames are which is configuration, not code — see ADMIN_HOSTS below.
 * No domain is written down anywhere in this repository.
 *
 * ── Why the admin is mounted at /console ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Next.js routes by folder, so two applications served at "/" cannot both be
 * called "/" on disk: src/app/(site)/page.tsx and an admin page.tsx would claim
 * the same URL and the build would refuse them. One of the two has to sit under
 * a folder. The admin does, at src/app/console.
 *
 * That folder is an implementation detail of the router and is NOT a URL. It is
 * unreachable from the outside on every host, including this one — see the 404
 * below — and nothing in src/admin knows it exists. Every link the admin writes
 * is a plain root path. The only thing that maps one to the other is the rewrite
 * at the bottom of adminHost(), which is invisible to the browser.
 *
 * ── What this is not ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Routing, not authentication. The session cookie still gates every admin page,
 * in src/app/console/(protected)/layout.tsx. What the split buys is that the
 * public domain carries no admin surface at all, and that the session cookie —
 * host-only, no `domain` attribute — is never sent to the public site.

 * Hosts that serve the admin, comma-separated, matched with and without a port.

 * Required in production. There is deliberately no domain baked in as a
 * fallback: an unset value means no host is the admin host, so the admin is
 * unreachable and the public site is unaffected — the safe way round to fail.
 *
 * Must be set at BUILD time as well as run time. Middleware runs in the Edge
 * runtime, where process.env is inlined when the app is compiled.
 *
 * The two localhost entries are the local development ports, not a site name,
 * and are additive: `npm run dev` proxies port 4000 into the one dev server, so
 * the admin answers there and the site answers on 3000.

 * no route is decided by whatever is running the app. `next start` resolves it
 * to the not-found page; a platform router that resolves rewrites against the
 * build manifest before the app ever sees them answers with ITS not-found page
 * instead — a plain-text error with a support ID, which is worse than useless
 * because it looks like the deployment is broken.
