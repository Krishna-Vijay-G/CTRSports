/**
 * An admin account, as everything except the password sees it.

 * account WITHOUT it, which is also why creating one takes a different shape
 * from reading one.
 *
 * Accounts have no order. They are listed by name, and there is no `sort_order`
 * here or on the table — a list of five people is read by looking, not by being
 * arranged.
 *
 * Shared by the server and the browser, so nothing here may import
 * `server-only`.
