/**
 * Who may edit what.
 *
 * The admin used to be one thing: signed in meant every screen. Then it became
 * three roles divided by the THING being edited — `pages` plus a list of page
 * keys, or `registrations`, or `owner` — which was the right axis for a site
 * with one sport, because "the page" and "the sport" were the same thing.
 *
 * With more than one sport that axis is short by a dimension. "May edit decks"
 * has to mean "may edit INCRC's decks", not everybody's, or the first
 * pickleball admin can rewrite the championship. So a scope is now a pair:
 *
 *     (site, module)
 *
 * and the role collapses to the only distinction genuinely about the ACCOUNT
 * rather than about a site:
 *
 *   owner    the super admin. Creates sites, creates sport admins, sees all.
 *   member   reaches exactly what their grants say, and nothing else.
 *
 * ── The three shapes a member has ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   sport admin   one grant: (site, "*"). Everything on that site, including
 *                 handing pieces of it to co-admins — but only on that site,
 *                 and never another "*".
 *   co-admin      one grant per module: (site, "articles"), (site, "decks")…
 *   nothing       no grants. Signs in, reaches no screen. Carried faithfully
 *                 from the old data, where an account could already be scoped
 *                 to nothing at all.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately NOT a module ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `media`. A folder belongs to a site, so "may they open incrc/decks/?" is
 * already answered by "have they any grant on incrc?". A separate grant would
 * be a second source of truth for a question the first one answers, and the two
 * would drift — which is exactly the failure `PAGE_KEYS` doubling as the folder
 * list was introduced to avoid.
 *
 * The predicates below are the only place a role or a grant is interpreted.
 * Everything else — the navigation, the console screens, every route guard —
 * asks one of them, so there is one answer to "may they?" rather than one per
 * call site.
 *
 * Shared by the server and the browser, so nothing here may import
 * `server-only`: the navigation is a client component and asks these too.
