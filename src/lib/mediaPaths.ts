 * What a folder may be called, and what a media key may look like.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `server-only`. The browser runs the same validator, so the
 * New folder dialog can explain a rejection as somebody types rather than after
 * a round trip — the same argument `src/lib/roles.ts` makes for being shared.
 * One rule in one place is also the only way the client and the server cannot
 * disagree about what is allowed.
 *
 * ── On traversal, precisely ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * S3 does not normalise `..`. `a/../b` is a literal object name, not `b`, so
 * there is no filesystem to escape from and no directory to climb out of. The
 * real risk is narrower and worse: naming a key under a DIFFERENT prefix.
 * `ENTRY_PREFIX` (`ctr-sports/entries/`) holds licence scans and passport
 * photographs, and it is a SIBLING of `MEDIA_PREFIX` (`ctr-sports/media/`),
 * not a child. So `startsWith(MEDIA_PREFIX)` is the whole defence, and no key
 * that passes `isMediaKey` can reach a registration attachment.
 *
 * Rejecting `%` matters for the same reason: it means no percent-decode
 * anywhere later in the stack can turn a stored name back into `..` or `/`.
 *
 * ── On the second half of this file ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Below the path rules sits a second question — WHOSE folder is this? — which
 * exists because a page editor scoped to the INCRC page must not be able to list,
 * fill or empty the decks page's media. That is an authorisation boundary, so it
 * is enforced in the routes; the predicates live here, beside the path rules they
 * are about, and are shared with the browser for the same reason the validators
 * are: the explorer has to know which folders to draw before it asks for any.
