/**
 * An event: one weekend of the season, at an address of its own.
 *
 * ── What this replaced ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `ctr.calendar_rounds`, which was a position in a list. A round was primary-
 * keyed by (section, position) and deleted and re-inserted wholesale on every
 * save of the page it sat on, so it had no identity: nothing could link to one,
 * nothing could point a foreign key at one, and it could carry nothing of its
 * own. The calendar's cards pointed at the CIRCUIT instead — a place, not a
 * weekend.
 *
 * An event is a row now, in the same shape as a deck, a form and an article: an
 * id, an address in `ctr.slugs` with a history of the ones it used to answer to,
 * a draft/published status, a cover and a rich-text body. It is served at
 * `/<sport>/calendar/<slug>`.
 *
 * ── Two ways of saying when, on purpose ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `date_from`/`date_to` are real dates (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`) and are what the
 * countdown counts to and what decides which event is next. `dates` is the line
 * the card prints; leave it blank and the range is written from the two dates,
 * which is what you want almost always — fill it in when the weekend has a name
 * the dates cannot express ("TBA", "Provisional, October").
 *
 * An event with no `date_from` simply has no countdown. That is the honest
 * rendering of a date nobody has fixed, and it is why the dates are not
 * required.
 *
 * ── `status` and `badge` are different things ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * `status` is draft or published, as everywhere else in this schema. `badge` is
 * the free-text chip the card prints — "Entries open", "Season finale" — which
 * was called `status` when it was the only one on the table, and was renamed by
 * migration 0018 so that neither has to be read twice.
 *
 * Shared by the server and the browser, so nothing here may import `server-only`.
