 * Doing it here rather than on the server is what keeps the upload route
 * dependency-free — no sharp in the serverless bundle — and means the bytes
 * stored in S3 are already the bytes the landing page will serve.
 *
 * SVG is passed through untouched: it is already tiny and rasterising it would
 * be a downgrade. Anything that fails to decode is passed through too; the
 * route still enforces its own type and size limits.
