/**
 * An article: something somebody WROTE, at an address of its own.
 *
 * Every other editor in this admin fills in a layout — a hero, a marquee, a strip
 * of partners, each a named slot with a picture and a line of copy. An article is
 * the other thing. It has a title, a line under it, a picture at the top, and then
 * however many paragraphs the writer needs, with their own emphasis and their own
 * pictures in the middle of them.
 *
 * ── Why it is a row and not a section ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The deck's reasoning, and it transfers whole: an article is published at
 * `/articles/<slug>` whether or not anything links to it, which is what makes it
 * something you can print on a poster or point three different pages at without
 * copying it three times. A section belongs to the page it sits on.
 *
 * The address is a stored row in `ctr.slugs`, not something derived from the
 * title, because the address outlives the title. Renaming pushes the old address
 * into the history and the public page permanently redirects it, exactly as a deck
 * and a registration form already do.
 *
 * ── Why `page` is nullable, and why null is the STRICT value ──────────────
 *
 * An article belongs to one page — the INCRC editors write the INCRC articles —
 * except when it belongs to all of them, which is the owner writing for the whole
 * site. That case has no page to name, so it names none.
 *
 * `null` therefore means "every page", and every guard reads it as OWNER ONLY.
 * That is the same reading `canOverrideUsage` already applies to a media reference
 * belonging to no page: a thing that is not one page's business can only be judged
 * by the account that can see every page it might affect. Unknown means stricter,
 * never looser.
 *
 * ── Where the body went ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `src/lib/richtext.ts`. The document model, its allowlist and the two readers
 * were defined here until an event needed the same thing, and none of it was
 * ever about articles. This file keeps what an ARTICLE is; the thing it is
 * written in lives next door.
 *
 * Shared by the server and the browser, so nothing here may import `server-only`.
