/**
 * A season: the year a championship runs, and the rounds under it.
 *
 * ── Why it is a row ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The same argument 0018 made about rounds, one level up. Before 0021 a season
 * was three words somebody typed into the calendar band's heading — "The 2026
 * Season" — and nothing else. Every round hung off the site, so the band drew
 * all of them; the first January after go-live, four rounds for 2027 would join
 * four for 2026 on one page, under a heading naming the wrong year, with a
 * countdown reaching across both.
 *
 * A season has a name, an order, a status and rounds under it. That is a row.
 *
 * ── Why it has no dates ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two more fields to keep in step with the rounds that already carry them, and
 * every question worth asking — when does it start, which one is running, is it
 * over — is answerable from the rounds. `currentSeason` below derives it, the
 * same way the calendar band picks the next round.
 *
 * Shared by the server and the browser, so nothing here may import `server-only`.
