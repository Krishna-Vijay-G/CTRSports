/**
 * Whether an address points at a picture or at a video, and where its poster is.
 *
 * ── Why the extension and not a stored field ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every image in this project is stored as a URL in a text column — a banner's
 * `image`, a partner's `logo`, a section's `data`, an article's `cover_image`,
 * a node inside a rich-text body. Adding "and is it a video?" as a second field
 * would mean touching all of them: a migration, twenty-six section models, every
 * normaliser, every panel and every renderer, to record something the address
 * already says.
 *
 * So the address says it. `…/opener-a1b2c3d4.mp4` is a video and
 * `…/opener-a1b2c3d4.webp` is not, which is a fact about a key the upload route
 * already decides from the file's MIME type — a file called `x.png` that is
 * really a video cannot name itself a PNG, and the reverse holds too.
 *
 * The cost is honest and small: a pasted external address with no extension
 * (`https://cdn.example.com/watch?v=…`) reads as an image and renders as a
 * broken one. That was already true of a pasted address that is not a picture,
 * and the field's own preview shows it immediately.
 *
 * ── The poster ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A `<video>` with nothing to show renders a black rectangle until its first
 * frame arrives, which on a banner is the first thing a visitor sees. So the
 * browser captures a frame at upload time and stores it BESIDE the video under
 * the same stem — `opener-a1b2c3d4.mp4` and `opener-a1b2c3d4.jpg` — and
 * `posterFor` swaps the extension to find it.
 *
 * Derived rather than stored, for the reason above. If the capture failed, or
 * the address was pasted from somewhere else, the poster 404s and the browser
 * falls back to the first frame — which is exactly the behaviour of no poster at
 * all, arrived at without a second field to keep in step.
 *
 * Shared by the server and the browser, so nothing here may import `server-only`.
 */

/**
 * What a `<video>` in a browser can play, and nothing else.
 *
 * `mov` is here and is a container rather than a codec: a QuickTime file holding
 * H.264 plays in Safari and often in Chrome, and one holding ProRes plays
 * nowhere. It is accepted because it is what a phone produces and refusing it
 * outright would be refusing the commonest thing anybody will try; the field's
 * own preview is where a file that cannot play says so.

 * itself a PNG, and `isVideoUrl` above trusts that. The upload routes share this
 * table so the direct-to-S3 path and the through-the-server path cannot admit
 * different things.

/**
 * How big each kind may be.
 *
 * ── Pictures: no ceiling ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There used to be one, at four megabytes, described as a backstop against a
 * caller that skipped the browser-side WebP conversion. What it actually did
 * was refuse the commonest thing anybody has — a photograph straight off a
 * phone, which is six or twelve megabytes BEFORE conversion and a few hundred
 * kilobytes after it. The check ran on the file as picked, so the conversion
 * that would have made the number irrelevant never got to happen.
 *
 * So there is no ceiling now. It is affordable because no picture passes
 * through a server any more: every uploader in the admin signs a PUT and sends
 * the bytes straight to S3, which is what stopped the platform's own
 * four-and-a-half megabyte body limit from being the real ceiling standing
 * behind this one. See src/lib/client/upload.ts.
 *
 * ── Video: still 200 MB ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A video is not converted by anything — there is no ffmpeg in a serverless
 * bundle and no transcoding pipeline here — so what is uploaded is what every
 * visitor downloads, and the number is a bandwidth decision as much as a
 * storage one. 200 MB is roughly three minutes of good 1080p; a banner loop
 * that size would be a mistake, and the field says so.
