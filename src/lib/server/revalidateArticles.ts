 * The pages that draw an article, cleared after one changes.

 * The index has to gain a new article, and stop offering one unpublished or
 * renamed under its old title.
 *
 * The article itself is cached for a minute like the rest of the public site.
 * The OLD address is cleared as well as the new one, because after a rename the
 * stale copy sits under the address that is now a redirect — so anybody on the
 * old link would keep getting the pre-rename page instead of being sent on.
 *
 * Both are the SITE's paths. See the note in revalidateDecks.ts.
