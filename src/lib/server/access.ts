/**
 * The question every admin route asks before it does anything.
 *
 * Each of these used to be two lines of "is anyone signed in", copied into
 * thirteen handlers. Now that being signed in is not the whole question, adding
 * the rest by hand thirteen times is how one route ends up asking something
 * subtly different from its neighbour — and a route that asks the wrong
 * question is a hole, not a bug.
 *
 * So they are here, one per kind of thing this admin owns, and a handler spends
 * two lines on the answer:
 *
 *     const denied = await guardSite(siteId, "articles");
 *     if (denied) return denied;
 *
 * `null` means allowed. A response means stop, and it is already the right one:
 * 401 when nobody is signed in — the browser has an expired cookie and should
 * be sent to sign in again — and 403 when someone is, because that is not a
 * login problem and telling them to sign in again would be a lie.
 *
 * ── What changed when sports became rows ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A guard takes a SITE as well as a module. `guardPage("incrc")` could be
 * written with the sport baked in because there was one; `guardSite(id,
 * "page")` cannot, and that is the point — a handler now has to say whose
 * decks it is about, and the compiler makes it.
 *
 * The bodies match the shape every other route in this project returns for a
 * failure: `{ error: string }`, in plain English.
