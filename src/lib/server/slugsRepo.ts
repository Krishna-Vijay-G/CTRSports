/**
 * Every address this site publishes, in one table.
 *
 * Two things live at an address somebody types, prints or puts behind a QR code
 * — a registration form and a deck — and both need the same four operations:
 * who holds this address, claim it, keep answering to the old one, and let one
 * go. That used to be eighty lines duplicated between formsRepo and decksRepo,
 * and the duplication was not the problem. This was:
 *
 *   `former_slugs` was a JSONB array with no unique index over it, so nothing
 *   stopped two decks claiming one address. Production had four rows claiming
 *   `new-deck` at once, and `/deck/new-deck` resolved to an empty draft that
 *   404s. See docs/defaults-sync.md.
 *
 * `ctr.slugs` makes that unrepresentable: PRIMARY KEY (entity_type, slug) means
 * an address belongs to exactly one thing, and a partial unique index over
 * (entity_type, entity_id) WHERE is_current means a thing has exactly one live
 * address. Resolution is one indexed lookup instead of
 * `slug = $1 OR former_slugs @> $2::jsonb` against an unindexed column.
 *
 * ── Why the table name is spelled out twice ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * `entity_type` decides which table holds the name, and a table name cannot be
 * a bind parameter. So the two joins are written out rather than built. Two
 * branches of four lines beat a string-built query in the one file whose whole
 * job is addresses somebody else could claim.
