/**
 * What points at an uploaded file, before anybody deletes it.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Deleting an object does not un-break a page. `max-age=31536000, immutable`
 * means a browser or a CDN may go on serving a deleted file for up to a year,
 * so a delete has no visible effect at all and then, months later, a picture
 * vanishes from a page nobody was editing. There is no undo and no obvious
 * cause. That gap between the action and the consequence is why this scan is
 * mandatory rather than advisory, and why the dialog in front of it says so in
 * words rather than a warning triangle.
 *
 * ── Why it pulls the text once instead of querying per key ────────────────
 *
 * The obvious shape is a `LIKE` per key, UNION'd. That is one round trip per
 * key through the Neon HTTP driver, so deleting a folder of two hundred files
 * would be two hundred round trips. Inverted here: pull the candidate columns
 * once, match in memory, resolve ids to names in the same pass. **Eight queries
 * total, however many keys are asked about.**
 *
 * Safe HERE AND ONLY HERE because these tables are tiny by construction —
 * `page_sections` is two pages' worth of sections, and the rest are
 * hand-curated lists of tens. If any of them ever grows past a few thousand
 * rows, switch to the per-key form; the `console.warn` below is what makes the
 * day that happens visible instead of gradual.
 *
 * ── What changed with the restructure ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This was specified against the old schema: five queries over `ctr_content`,
 * `ctr_decks`, `ctr_sports`, `ctr_tracks` and `ctr_forms`, pulling whole JSONB
 * blobs as text. Four of those tables no longer hold URLs — `content` does not
 * exist, deck pages are rows, track links are rows. So the scan follows the
 * data:
 *
 *   page_sections.data   still a document, still matched as text
 *   banners.image        an exact-match column now
 *   posts.image          "
 *   partners.logo        "
 *   deck_pages.url       "
 *   sports               logo_url and photo_url, as before
 *   tracks               photo_url and map_url; links moved to track_links.href
 *   forms                fields and sections stay JSONB, so still text
 *   articles             cover_image is a column, body is a document
 *
 * The originally-stated reasoning — "pull the text once, match in memory" —
 * therefore only applies to the three that are still documents. The rest are
 * ordinary indexed columns and a URL either equals one or does not, so those
 * are matched with `= ANY($1)` and the database does the work. That is a better
 * scan than the one specified, not a compromise on it.
 *
 * ── Two things it cannot do ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is a SNAPSHOT, not a lock. Somebody can save a page referencing a file
 * between the scan and the delete. The window is seconds, and the delete route
 * re-checks on confirm and answers 409 again if it changed — but there is no
 * advisory-lock mechanism anywhere in this app and this is not the place to
 * invent one.
 *
 * And it can only see THIS database. Not
 * a URL somebody pasted into an external document, an email, or the older CTR
 * site. Which is why the dialog says "nothing on this site points at these"
 * rather than "this is unused".
