/**
 * Re-addressing every reference to a file that has moved.
 *
 * ── Why this is needed at all ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * S3 has no rename. Moving a folder is copy-then-delete, and in between the two
 * every row holding one of the old addresses has to be pointed at the new one —
 * otherwise the delete turns a working page into a broken image. This is that
 * middle step, and `moveEntityFolder` is the only thing that should run it.
 *
 * ── Why a PREFIX rather than a list of keys ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every file in a folder move keeps its own name and changes only the folder
 * above it, so the whole move is one string substitution:
 *
 *   ctr-sports/media/decks/world-of-ctr/  →  ctr-sports/media/decks/world-of-ctr-2026/
 *
 * One `replace` per column, twelve columns, one round trip each — against one
 * statement per FILE per column, which for a fifty-page deck would be six
 * hundred. The rescue path (survivors of a deleted entity going to `uploads/`)
 * has the same shape for the same reason: they all come from one folder and all
 * land in one folder.
 *
 * ── Why the KEY and not the URL ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * What is stored is an absolute URL, but which one depends on how the
 * environment is set: `publicUrl` prefers `S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, falls back to
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_BASE_URL`, and falls back again to the raw S3 hostname. A
 * row written before the CDN existed carries a different host from one written
 * after it, and both are live. So the needle is the KEY — the part of the URL
 * that is the same whatever the host — exactly as `findUsage` matches, and for
 * exactly the same reason.
 *
 * ── The column list ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every column in this schema that can hold an image address, which is the same
 * list `mediaUsage.ts` scans and `scripts/migrate-media-domain.mjs` rewrites. The
 * three JSONB ones go through their text form, which is safe because a key
 * contains no character JSON escapes and `jsonb` is normalised on storage — the
 * round trip changes the string and nothing else.
 *
 * `forms.fields` and `forms.sections` are here even though nothing writes an
 * upload into them, because their text is author-written and an editor can paste
 * a URL. `form_entries.answers` is deliberately NOT here: registration
 * attachments live under `ENTRY_PREFIX`, a sibling of the media prefix that this
 * function can never name.
 *
 * `updated_at` is left alone throughout. The admin screens read it as "somebody
 * edited this", and re-addressing the same photograph is not an edit.

 * What a delete calls, so that removing a file CHANGES the page instead of
 * breaking it later. See MEDIA_REMOVED_URL in src/lib/media.ts for why that
 * distinction matters as much as it does.
 *
 * ── Why a regular expression, when the mover uses `replace` ───────────────
 *
 * A move keeps the address and swaps one folder for another inside it, so a
 * literal substring is exactly the right tool. This has to remove the WHOLE
 * address and put an unrelated one in its place — and it cannot know what that
 * address looks like, because the host it was written with depends on when it
 * was written. `publicUrl` prefers `S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, falls back to
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_BASE_URL`, and falls back again to the raw S3 hostname; a
 * row from before the CDN carries a different host from one written after it,
 * and both are live.
 *
 * So the pattern is `[^"\s]*<key>`: the key, plus everything in front of it
 * back to the nearest quote or space. In a plain column that is the start of
 * the value, and the whole URL goes. In a JSON document it is the opening
 * quote of the string, so `{"src":"https://…/key.webp"}` becomes
 * `{"src":"/images/media_removed.png"}` and nothing around it is touched.
 * Excluding whitespace is what keeps it from eating the words in front of a
 * URL pasted into a sentence.
 *
 * One pattern for every key, as an alternation, so this stays one statement
 * per table however many files are being deleted.
 *
 * ── Idempotent, like the mover ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A row that has already been repointed no longer contains the key, so a
 * re-run after a partial failure changes nothing.
