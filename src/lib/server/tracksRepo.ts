 * came straight out as `Track[]`. They are columns now and cannot be anything
 * else. And the slug is stored rather than derived on every render.
 *
 * `listTracks` is wrapped in React `cache()`. A circuit page asks for the
 * circuits twice — once in `generateMetadata` and once in the component — and
 * that was two full scans of the table on every request. `cache()` dedupes
 * within one request and nothing wider, so an edit is still visible at once.
