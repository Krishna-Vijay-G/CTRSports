/**
 * Every read and write of ctr.admins that is not the sign-in itself.
 *
 * `password_hash` is never in a column list here. That is the one rule this
 * file has: signing in reads it, in auth.ts, and nothing else ever needs it —
 * so it cannot be returned by accident to a screen, a route or a log line.
 *
 * Changing a password deletes that account's sessions, in the same transaction
 * as the change. Anything else would leave a browser signed in with a password
 * that no longer exists, which is exactly the situation someone is trying to
 * end when they change one.
 *
 * `pages` — which editors a scoped account may open — is a join table now
 * rather than a JSONB array on the row, so a grant is a real foreign key into
 * both `ctr.admins` and `ctr.sites`. A site that is not a site cannot be
 * granted, and deleting a sport takes its grants with it instead of leaving
 * them to be filtered out on every read.
 *
 * What changed in phase 1 is the shape of a grant: it was a page key and is now
 * a (site, module) pair, so `ctr.admin_pages` became `ctr.admin_grants`. The
 * site's SLUG is selected alongside its id for the reason `AdminSession` gives
 * — the media predicates compare folders, and a folder is named by slug.
