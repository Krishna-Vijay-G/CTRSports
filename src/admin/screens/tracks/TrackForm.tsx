/**
 * Everything about one circuit, in the order the public page reads it.
 *
 * The panels are named after what they produce, not after the columns they
 * write: "Headline numbers" is the strip under the circuit's name, "The record"
 * is the table beside the layout. Someone who has never seen this schema should
 * be able to open a panel and know which part of the page they are about to
 * change, and every hint here says so in as many words.
 *
 * That is deliberate and it is the reason the groupings do not match the
 * database. `length` and `lap_record_time` sit together because they appear
 * together on the page; `fia_grade` sits apart from them because it does not.
 *
 * The form holds no state of its own. The editor owns the draft, this draws it,
 * and every change goes straight back up — so the preview beside it is never a
 * keystroke behind.
