 * landing page is not.
 *

 *
 * The list is not one page's worth of rows. It is whatever this account may edit,
 * which for an owner is everything and for a page editor is their pages —
 * narrowed by the server, in SQL, so an article they cannot open never reaches
 * the browser. That is why the rail shows which page each one belongs to: on this
 * screen alone, two adjacent rows can be owned by different people.
 *
 * Each article is its own row, so Save writes the open one and only the open one.
 * Position is the exception: it belongs to the list rather than to any row, so a
 * drag saves itself, debounced, without touching anything else.
