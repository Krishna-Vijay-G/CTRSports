 * everything through one `set`. What it holds that no other form in this admin
 * does is the body, and that is deliberately the LAST thing on the panel — the
 * four fields above it are the ones that decide where the article lives and who
 * can see it, and they are quick. Writing is the long job and it belongs at the
 * bottom where the column can scroll.
