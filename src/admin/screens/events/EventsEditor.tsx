/**
 * One sport's season, on the same three-column screen as every other editor.
 *
 * Sidebar, preview, fields — and the rail lists the events themselves, in the
 * order the season runs. This screen is what migration 0018 was for: a round
 * used to be a row in a repeater inside the calendar band's panel, saved with
 * the page it sat on, and there was nowhere to put a report, a cover or an entry
 * link because there was no row to put them on.
 *
 * Modelled on `ArticlesEditor`, with one difference worth naming: the list is
 * one sport's, not "whatever this account may reach". A season belongs to a
 * sport, so the screen is per sport and the server has already guarded it.
 *
 * Each event is its own row, so Save writes the open one and only the open one.
 * Position is the exception: it belongs to the list rather than to any row, so a
 * drag saves itself, debounced, without touching anything else — and the order
 * of this list IS the order the calendar band draws.
