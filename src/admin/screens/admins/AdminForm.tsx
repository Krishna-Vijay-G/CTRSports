/**
 * One account's record.
 *
 * The grant grid appears only for a `member`, because for an owner it decides
 * nothing — they have every sport already — and showing a list of ticks that
 * changes nothing is how an admin ends up believing it did.
 *
 * ── The grid, and why it is a grid ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A scope is a pair now: which sport, and which part of it. That is two
 * dimensions, so it is drawn as two — a row per sport, a button per module —
 * rather than as one flat list of "INCRC decks, INCRC articles, Pickle
 * articles" that nobody can scan.
 *
 * `Everything` is the first button in each row and it is the sport-admin grant.
 * Ticking it is what makes somebody the person that sport belongs to, and it
 * greys the rest because they would all be redundant: `*` already covers every
 * module, including ones switched on later.
 *
 * The password field is blank on an account that already exists, and blank
 * means "leave it alone" rather than "clear it" — there is no such thing as an
 * account with no password. Typing one is the only way to change it, and doing
 * so signs that person out everywhere, which the note says out loud because it
 * is a surprising thing to happen to someone else while they are working.
