/**
 * Writing, with the formatting an article actually needs.
 *
 * ── Why there is a dependency here at all ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is the project's first UI dependency past framer-motion, and it is one
 * (TipTap, which is ProseMirror) rather than none because the alternative is
 * `contentEditable` — and `contentEditable` is not a text editor, it is a raw
 * browser API whose behaviour differs per engine for every one of: pressing
 * Enter inside a list, pasting from Word, selecting across two blocks, undo after
 * an image insert, and where the caret lands afterwards. Hand-rolling that is not
 * a smaller amount of code than importing it, it is the same amount of code
 * written worse and discovered by writers.
 *
 * ── What it is allowed to produce ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Exactly the node types in `RichDoc`, which is why `strike`, `code` and
 * `codeBlock` are switched OFF in StarterKit below rather than left on and
 * dropped later. An editor that can make something the storage layer then
 * silently removes is an editor that loses somebody's work between pressing a
 * button and pressing Save.
 *
 * Headings are levels 2 and 3 only: the page prints the article's title as its
 * H1, and a second H1 in the body is a broken document outline, not a style.
 *
 * ── Where an image goes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Into the article's own folder, which arrives through the `UploadFolder`
 * context exactly as it does for every `ImageField` on every other screen. There
 * are four ways to add one — the button, the library, a drop and a paste — and
 * all four funnel through `addFiles`, so there is one answer to "what happens to
 * a picture" rather than four.
 */

  let count = 0;

    if (node.type.name === "image") count += 1;
  });
  return count;
}

/**
 * Whether a dropped or pasted file is one the uploader would take.
 *
 * `extensionFor` rather than a `type.startsWith` pair, because the browser
 * frequently has no MIME type to offer — Windows reports nothing at all for a
 * `.mkv` — and the two tests would then disagree about the same file: the
 * picker's `accept` would show it, the drop would silently ignore it. One
 * answer, used by the routes as well. See src/lib/media.ts.
 */
const usable = (files: File[]) => files.filter((file) => extensionFor(file.type, file.name));

/**
 * The `image` node, which is now a media node in all but name.
 *
 * An article body stores one shape for a picture — `{ type: "image", attrs }`
 * — and the public renderer has drawn whichever of the two it turns out to be
 * since videos existed: `ArticleBody` hands the src to `<Media>`, which reads
 * the extension and returns an `<img>` or a `<video>`. Nothing about the
 * document had to change to allow a video in the middle of an article.
 *
 * What HAD to change is the editor, which was still serialising every node to
 * `<img>` — so an uploaded clip saved correctly, published correctly, and
 * showed a broken-image icon to the person who had just put it there.
 *
 * ── Why a still and not a moving preview ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `controls` and `preload="metadata"`, deliberately, where the page itself
 * autoplays muted. Eight clips playing at once behind somebody trying to write
 * is a worse editor, and ProseMirror builds its DOM with `setAttribute`, where
 * a `muted` ATTRIBUTE does not reliably set the muted PROPERTY that autoplay
 * policies actually test — so an autoplaying preview would have been a coin
 * flip between motion and a frozen first frame anyway.
 *
 * The poster is the still captured at upload time, found by swapping the
 * extension. It costs one derived string and is the difference between a black
 * rectangle and a recognisable frame.
