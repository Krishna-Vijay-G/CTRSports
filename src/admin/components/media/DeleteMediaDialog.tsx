/**
 * The one dialog in front of every delete — files and folders alike.
 *
 * ── Why a scan happens before the button is even offered ──────────────────
 *
 * Deleting used to be a delayed-action fault. The object went and the address
 * stayed, and because every upload carries `max-age=31536000, immutable`, a
 * browser that had already seen the picture went on showing it for up to a
 * year — so the delete appeared to do nothing, and then months later a picture
 * vanished off a page nobody had touched, with no undo and no obvious cause.
 *
 * The delete now repoints every reference at a "media removed" placeholder
 * before it removes anything, so the consequence lands at the moment of the
 * act instead of arriving unannounced later. That does not make the scan
 * optional: the pages still CHANGE, and the person pressing the button is the
 * only one who can say whether that is wanted. What it changes is the sentence
 * below, which used to have to warn about a fault that had not happened yet.
 *
 * ── The three states ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   checking   the scan is running
 *   clean      nothing points at these, one press deletes
 *   in use     what points at them, and either a two-press "Delete anyway" or,
 *              if any of it is on a page this account cannot edit, no delete at
 *              all and the name of the page to go and ask about
 *
 * ── The race, handled rather than ignored ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The scan is a snapshot, not a lock — somebody can save a page in the seconds
 * between this opening and the button being pressed. The server re-checks on
 * confirm and answers 409 again with the fresh references; this re-renders them
 * and goes back to needing two presses. That is the correct handling of it.
