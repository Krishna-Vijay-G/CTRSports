/**
 * The address box, for the two things that have one.
 *
 * It asks the server who holds the address WHILE it is being typed, which is the
 * whole reason it exists as its own component rather than an `<Input>` in each
 * panel. The answer used to arrive as a 409 on Save — after the admin had
 * finished editing everything else, and phrased as a failure of the save rather
 * than of the one field that caused it.
 *
 * One kind means one namespace, with one exception: a season and a round are
 * both served by `/<sport>/calendar/<slug>`, so both ask about the two together
 * — see calendarSlugs.ts. That is why the message under the box can name a
 * round while a season is being edited.
 *
 * Three answers, three different things to do about them:
 *
 * FREE, or the address it already had — nothing to say beyond where it will
 * live.
 *
 * Held as somebody's CURRENT address — refused, and not offered as a choice.
 * Taking it would leave that form or deck with nowhere to be, which is not a
 * thing to do as a side effect of typing in a box on a different screen. The
 * message names it so the admin knows where to go.
 *
 * Held only in somebody's HISTORY — offered, with a button. That address is a
 * redirect and nothing else, and reusing one is a real thing to want: it is how
 * `2026-entry` moves from last season's form to this season's. Taking it is its
 * own click and its own request, so nothing about a Save silently rewrites
 * another record's redirects on the way past.
