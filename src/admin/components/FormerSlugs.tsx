 * The addresses this thing used to live at, and a way to retire one.

 * The list itself was only ever shown for decks, and only as a sentence — so a
 * form's old addresses were invisible, and neither kind could be edited at all.
 * That is the half of the redirect history nobody could see: an address typed
 * once, corrected a second later, was answered for by that record forever, and
 * the only sign of it was a different record being refused that address months
 * afterwards with no way to find out why.
 *
 * Removing one here is a change to the record like any other — it lands on
 * Save, alongside everything else on the panel, and the server says out loud
 * what it retired. The server will only ever let this list SHRINK; see the note
 * on `updateForm`.
