 * The admin host's root has no screen of its own — it sends you to your first.

 * scoped: sending a co-admin to the landing editor would land them on a screen
 * that answers `notFound()`, so the root has to ask the same question the
 * navigation asks and pick the first sport this account actually holds.
 *
 * An account with nothing is a real state — an owner has made an account and
 * not yet ticked anything on it — and it gets a plain card saying so rather
 * than a redirect loop or a 404 that reads as "the admin is broken".
