 * saved with the page they sat on. An event is a record now — its own address,
 * its own cover, its own report — so it is edited where a deck and an article
 * are, and the band simply draws whatever is published.
 *
 * Deliberately uses the throwing loader for the events themselves: an editor
 * that quietly showed an empty season after a failed read would invite someone
 * to announce the same four weekends a second time. The circuits, the forms and
 * the chrome beside it are only there for the pickers and the preview.
