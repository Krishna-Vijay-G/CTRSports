 * Signed in, and nothing more.
 *
 * Which SCREEN is each screen's own problem — see the note on `requireSite` in
 * src/lib/server/access.ts. What this adds is the two things the navigation
 * cannot be drawn without: the account's grants, and the sports that exist.
 *
 * The sites are read here rather than in every screen because `listSites` is
 * wrapped in React `cache()`, so the layout and the page below it share one
 * query — and the navigation needs all of them regardless of which one is open.
 *
 * `MediaSync` hangs off here for the same reason and draws nothing: it is the
 * one place mounted for every admin screen and unmounted only on sign out,
 * which is exactly the lifetime a background sync wants. Below the auth check,
 * so it never polls on behalf of somebody who is not signed in.
