 * files mixed together in the order they were uploaded. It is where the legacy
 * flat objects live, and it is what stops them looking lost now that everything
 * new lands in a folder.
 *
 * ── The one thing that changed here, and why ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * The response SHAPE is untouched — `{ configured, media }`, exactly as before,
 * because that is the only contract `MediaPicker` has ever had. The CONTENTS are
 * now filtered by `canBrowseFolder`.
 *
 * That is not a refinement, it is a hole being closed. This route returned every
 * object in the bucket to any account holding any single page grant, which was
 * merely leaky while the library was read-only and became dangerous the moment a
 * delete button existed. Filtering an array already in memory costs nothing.
 *
 * The limit is applied AFTER the filter, or an account scoped to one page would
 * get whatever fraction of the newest two hundred objects happened to be theirs
 * — a "Recent" view that goes mysteriously empty the busier another page gets.

/**
 * Removes files. Two locks and a confirmation stand in front of it.
 *
 *   1. `canWriteFolder` on every key — you may only delete out of a folder that
 *      belongs to a page you edit. All-or-nothing: one key you may not touch
 *      refuses the whole request, which is the posture the entries route already
 *      takes, because a request half-honoured is one nobody can reason about.
 *   2. `findUsage` — anything still referenced answers 409 with the references,
 *      and only a second request carrying `confirm: true` goes through.
 *   3. `canOverrideUsage` on that second request — a warning may only be
 *      confirmed past by somebody who administers every page that would break.
 *
 * The 409 is re-checked on confirm and can fire twice. `findUsage` is a snapshot
 * and not a lock — its own doc comment says so — so somebody can save a page in
 * the seconds between the dialog opening and the button being pressed. Answering
 * 409 again with the fresh references is the correct handling of that race.
