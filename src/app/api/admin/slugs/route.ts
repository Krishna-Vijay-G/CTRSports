/**
 * Who holds an address, and how to take one back.
 *
 * This exists because the answer was only ever available at the moment of
 * saving. An admin typed an address, pressed Save, and found out from a 409
 * that it belonged to something else — by which point the rest of their edits
 * were sitting unsaved behind the refusal. Asked while they type, the same fact
 * is a sentence under the box.
 *
 * It is one route for every kind rather than one each, because the question and
 * the answer are identical and only the table differs. What does NOT collapse
 * is the guard: the kind decides which module is required, so a deck editor
 * cannot use this to enumerate the registration forms.
 *
 * Each kind is checked SEPARATELY and never against another. They publish under
 * different prefixes — /register/, /deck/ and /articles/ — so `entry-pack` being
 * both a form and a deck is two different pages, not a collision.
 *
 * ── Every question is now about one sport ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `?site=<slug>` is required on both methods. An address is unique within a
 * site since migration 0014, so "is `opener` free?" has no answer without one —
 * it is free on pickleball and taken on INCRC, and both are correct.
 *
 * That also retires the `guardWrite` hook this route used to carry. It existed
 * because releasing an ARTICLE's address edited a record whose owner depended
 * on the page it was on, which `guard` could not know before reading the row.
 * An article belongs to a site, the site is in the query string, and the guard
 * knows it before anything is read — so the second guard has nothing left to
 * ask. `releaseFormerSlug` scopes its own `WHERE` by site as well, so a mistyped
 * id cannot reach across sports even if this handler were wrong.
