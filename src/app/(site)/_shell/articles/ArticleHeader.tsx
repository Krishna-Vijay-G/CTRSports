/**
 * The four things every article carries, above the words.
 *
 * Cover, title, subtext, date — asked for as a set, and drawn as one so the
 * public page and the admin preview cannot drift apart. Each is optional and each
 * is simply absent when it is blank: a heading rule over nothing, or an empty
 * picture frame, is worse than a shorter page.
 *
 * The date is printed by `articleDate` in src/lib/articles.ts, which is also
 * what the index and the /incrc announcement card print — one article, one date,
 * spelled one way wherever it appears. It is assembled rather than localised;
 * the note on that function says why.
