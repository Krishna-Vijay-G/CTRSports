/**
 * One deck, at its own address.
 *
 * A run of images, top to bottom, with the site's own header and footer around
 * them — which is the whole point of it being here rather than a PDF on a file
 * host: somebody who arrives from a poster or a shared link lands on the site,
 * with a way back into it and the footer's contact details under them.
 *
 * ── Three states, the same three a form has ───────────────────────────────
 *
 *   missing or draft   404. A draft is not on the internet, and "this exists
 *                      but you cannot see it" is a way of putting it there.
 *   a former address   a permanent redirect to the current one, so a printed
 *                      link corrects itself rather than dying.
 *   no pages yet       the heading and a line saying so. A published deck with
 *                      nothing in it is somebody halfway through the job, and a
 *                      blank page reads as a broken one.
 *
 * Cached for a minute like the rest of the public site, and cleared on write —
 * see revalidateDecks.ts. A deck is fifty images; making the page dynamic to
 * catch an edit nobody has made would be paying for it on every view.
