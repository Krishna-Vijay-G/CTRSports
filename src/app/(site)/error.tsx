/**
 * What a visitor sees when a public page cannot be drawn.
 *
 * Every loader on this site used to swallow a database error and return the
 * defaults — a document of copy kept in the repo — so an outage rendered a
 * complete, plausible, WRONG page: last quarter's calendar, a championship that
 * had moved on, a form that was no longer open. Nobody could tell from looking,
 * which is what made it worse than a blank screen. The defaults are gone and the
 * loaders throw, and this is where that lands.
 *
 * Deliberately says nothing about the cause. A visitor cannot act on "Neon
 * refused the connection", and an error page that prints internals to the
 * street is a gift to whoever is probing it. The real error goes to the console,
 * which is where the people who can fix it are looking.
 *
 * A CLIENT component, because every `error.tsx` is one — React needs to attach
 * it as a boundary in the browser, and `reset` is a callback it hands back.
 *
 * It renders inside the root layout, so the fonts and globals.css are already
 * there and the site's own classes work. `global-error.tsx` is the one that
 * cannot rely on that.
