 * How a circuit's layout gets drawn, wherever it is drawn.
 *
 * Three sources, in order of preference, and the order is the whole point:
 *
 *   svg_path   a line the page draws itself, in the page's own colour. This is
 *              the one the design is built around — it takes the accent, it
 *              scales to any size without going soft, and the same circuit reads
 *              on the black page and on the admin's white tile without two files.
 *   map_url    a picture of a layout, whatever the circuit publishes. Always on
 *              white: track maps are drawn as dark ink on paper, and one with a
 *              transparent background would be invisible on this page.
 *   nothing    an honest empty frame that says so, rather than a blank hole.
 *
 * Shared by the public circuits pages and the admin's preview, so it takes a
 * whole Track rather than the two picture fields — every caller has one, and a
 * fourth source added later is then one edit here.

 * opacity it does — a corner motif that says "circuit" at a glance and gives
 * each card its own silhouette, without competing with the type in front of it.
 *
 * A raster map needs handling a drawn path does not. Published layouts are dark
 * ink on white or on nothing, which is invisible on a dark panel; `invert` turns
 * the ink light, and `screen` drops the black ground that inverting a white one
 * leaves behind. Between them, a JPEG on white and a transparent PNG both come
 * out as pale line art.
