/**
 * Dark, card-led palette.
 *
 * The layout is the same one the design reference uses — a page colour showing
 * around one big rounded card — but inverted: the page is near-black and the
 * card sits a shade above it. Depth comes from those two steps plus `panel` for
 * anything nested inside the card, never from shadows, which do not read on a
 * dark background.
 *
 * `accent` is the one bright colour, and it carries every primary button, badge
 * and the call-to-action band. `accent-ink` is the only thing that may sit ON
 * accent — near-black, because yellow needs dark type over it.
 *
 * The second block of colours is the ADMIN's, and it is a different design
 * altogether: a monochrome tool palette in the manner of Reactive Resume, where
 * depth is one step of grey at a time and the absence of colour is the point.
 * Two exceptions, both meaningful: `primary` is CTR's yellow so the one action
 * that writes to the database is unmistakable, and `destructive` is red.
 *
 * The two sets never mix. Site components use page/surface/panel/accent; admin
 * components use background/card/muted/primary. Anything using both would look
 * like neither.
