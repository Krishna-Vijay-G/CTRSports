/**
 * Moves the media URLs already sitting in the database onto the new host.
 *
 *   npm run migrate:media -- --dry-run     count what would change
 *   npm run migrate:media                  change it
 *
 * ── Why this is needed at all ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `publicUrl()` returns an ABSOLUTE URL and the admin stores exactly what the
 * upload route handed back (src/admin/components/ImageField.tsx,
 * src/admin/screens/decks/DeckForm.tsx), while `normalise.image()` passes any
 * http(s) string straight through. So every row written before the CDN existed
 * holds the raw S3 hostname, and setting NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_BASE_URL only
 * changes what NEW uploads get. This is the one-shot that catches up the rest.
 *
 * Run it AFTER the distribution is live and the code is deployed, and BEFORE
 * the bucket's public-read policy comes off — an object whose URL is still the
 * S3 one keeps working right up until that last step, and then does not.
 *
 * ── What it touches ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every column that can hold an image URL, per migrations/0001_baseline.sql.
 * The JSONB ones are replaced through their text form, which is safe because a URL
 * contains no character JSON escapes — and jsonb is already normalised on
 * storage, so the round-trip changes nothing but the string.
 *
 * `forms.fields` / `sections` and `tracks.links` are in the list even
 * though nothing writes an upload into them, because their text is
 * author-written and an editor can paste one. A pasted URL that is missed here
 * is a picture that vanishes the day the bucket goes private.
 *
 * NOT touched, deliberately:
 *   form_entries.answers  registration attachments live under ENTRY_PREFIX,
 *                             are never given a public URL, and leave only
 *                             through an authenticated route that streams them.
 *                             They have no host in them to rewrite.
 *   enquiries                 nothing renders a URL out of a stranger's message.
 *   tracks.svg_path           an inline SVG `d` attribute, not an address.
 *
 * `updated_at` is left alone. The admin screens read it as "somebody edited
 * this", and re-addressing the same photograph is not an edit — the pictures
 * are identical, only the road to them changed.
 *
 * ── Life expectancy ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One-shot, and it has now outlived two schema changes without being run.
 * It copes with both:
 *
 *   the NAME    0001 moved these tables into a `ctr` schema and dropped the
 *               prefix, so each is looked up through `to_regclass` and answers
 *               to `ctr.decks` or `public.ctr_decks`, whichever is there.
 *   the SHAPE   0006 took the page documents apart and 0008 dropped
 *               `content` outright, so the column list is chosen from the
 *               schema this database actually has — see SCHEMAS below.
 *
 * That is the whole of the accommodation, and it is more than a one-shot should
 * need. Once this has run against production it is spent: delete it rather than
 * leaving it lying around looking like a tool.
