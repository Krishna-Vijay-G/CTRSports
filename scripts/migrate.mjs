/**
 * The migration runner.
 *
 *   npm run db:migrate     apply everything not yet applied
 *   npm run db:status      say what is applied and what is not
 *
 * ── What replaced what ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This file used to import scripts/schema.mjs and run the whole schema on every
 * invocation: 846 lines of CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS with backfills between
 * them, no version, no record of what had run. Two consequences, both real: a
 * CHECK constraint could not be added at all — Postgres has no ADD CONSTRAINT IF
 * NOT EXISTS and the file had no way to know whether it had run before — and
 * nobody could answer "is this database up to date?" except by reading it.
 *
 * Now: `migrations/NNNN_name.sql`, applied in order, each recorded in
 * `ctr.schema_migrations` with a checksum, each inside one transaction. A
 * migration either lands whole or does not land.
 *
 * ── Why a WebSocket connection and not the HTTP driver ────────────────────
 *
 * The rest of the project talks to Neon over HTTP, which is the right shape for
 * serverless: one round-trip per query, no pool to leak between invocations. But
 * it is one STATEMENT per round-trip — "cannot insert multiple commands into a
 * prepared statement" — and it has no way to hold a transaction open across
 * them. A migration file is many statements that have to land together, so this
 * one script opens a real connection, exactly as psql would.
 *
 * That is also why the whole file is sent verbatim rather than split on
 * semicolons: a splitter would have to understand dollar-quoted bodies, and
 * `DO $$ ... $$` blocks are how the baseline does anything conditional.
