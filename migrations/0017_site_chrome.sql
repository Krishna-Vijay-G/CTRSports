-- 0017 · the header and footer become each site's own
--
-- 0012 created `ctr.pages.kind = 'chrome'` and put nothing in it, with a note
-- saying this migration is the one that has something to put there. This is it.
--
-- Six sections — `brand`, `nav`, `splash`, `contact`, `socials`, `footer` — have
-- been sitting on the ROOT site's HOME page since 0015, mixed in with the
-- landing page's own bands, and every route in the project has drawn them
-- whatever site it was serving. That was the truth of the old model: there was
-- one header because there was one site.
--
-- After this each site has a `chrome` page of its own, and `getChrome(site)`
-- reads that site's. A sport admin can put their own mark, their own navigation
-- and their own footer on their own sport, which is most of what the brief asked
-- for and the last thing phase 3 left behind.
--
-- ── Why INCRC gets a COPY rather than a blank page ────────────────────────
--
-- Because the bar for this migration is that the rendered site does not change.
-- A blank chrome renders an empty navigation bar and a footer with nothing above
-- it — a visible regression on every page of the sport, to be repaired by hand
-- afterwards. A copy renders exactly what /incrc renders today, and the sport
-- admin changes it when they have something to change it to.
--
-- The one field NOT copied is the splash screen's, and that is also a
-- do-not-change-the-page decision: only the landing page has ever drawn a splash
-- (a sport reached from it has already paid that cost), so copying the root's
-- logo and title would put a full-screen cover on /incrc that nobody asked for.
-- The section is still created, and still empty, which is exactly what the
-- renderer treats as "no splash".
--
-- ── Why the list of six is written out here ───────────────────────────────
--
-- A migration cannot ask the registry which sections are chrome — that lives in
-- TypeScript, and the whole reason `page_sections.type` has no CHECK constraint
-- (see 0015) is that the database is deliberately not the vocabulary. So this
-- file names the six as they stand today. That is right for a migration, which
-- is a statement about one moment: a seventh chrome section added next year is
-- created on the chrome page by the console and has nothing to move.
