-- 0011 · /incrc gains an announcement card, second on the page
--
-- One card, directly under the ticker and above the introduction: a coloured
-- block with a picture on the left and, on the right, a headline and a button
-- pointing at one article, one deck, or one typed address. The page had no way
-- to say "this just happened" — the nearest thing was `posts`, a grid of nine
-- cards near the foot of it, which is a newsroom rather than a headline.
--
-- ── Why the FIELDS need no migration ──────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Because 0006 made a section a row keyed by the document's own top-level key,
-- and `writePage` inserts one row per key it finds. Adding `announcement` to
-- IncrcContent is therefore the whole of the storage change: its row appears the
-- first time somebody saves, and until then the key is simply absent, which
-- `normaliseIncrcContent` fills from BLANK_INCRC_CONTENT field by field. That is
-- the contract docs/defaults-sync.md records and it is why there is no CREATE
-- and no ALTER below.
--
-- ── Why the POSITION does ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- `sections()` appends an id it has never seen to the END of the running order.
-- That is the right rule — a section added in code must show up rather than
-- silently never appear — but it means the deploy that lands this code would put
-- the card at the FOOT of the live page and leave it there until somebody
-- noticed and dragged it. "Between the ticker and the intro" is where it was
-- asked for, and the running order lives in this table, so this is where it is
-- said. Same reasoning as 0009: without a backfill, the deploy quietly gets the
-- page wrong.
--
-- ── Never overwrites ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- The whole thing is guarded on the row being absent. If somebody has already
-- saved /incrc against the new code, the section has a row and a position they
-- chose, and this must not reach in and move it.
--
-- The `data` written is the shape's defaults and NOT copy: a colour, because
-- that value is painted into a style attribute and has nothing to fall back to,
-- and the ink rule. With no words the renderer's own guard returns null, so a
-- visible-but-empty section puts nothing on the page — which is what the first
-- editor to open the tab should find.
--
-- No BEGIN/COMMIT of its own: scripts/migrate.mjs already sends each file inside
-- one, together with the ledger row that records it. 0009 writes its own pair
-- and is the only file here that does — an inner COMMIT closes the runner's
-- transaction early, which is not something to copy.
