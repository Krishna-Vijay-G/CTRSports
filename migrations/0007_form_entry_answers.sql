-- 0007 · a submission's answers become rows
--
-- This is the cheapest moment this work will ever have: `form_entries` holds
-- **zero rows**, and so does `enquiries`. There is no backfill in this file, no
-- data to reconcile and nothing to get wrong. The same migration written after
-- the first race weekend would be a different job.
--
-- ── What it replaces ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- `form_entries.answers` is a flat JSONB map keyed by field id. Sorting the
-- entries table by an answer therefore costs an unindexable expression over
-- `answers->>key` with a regex test and a `::numeric` cast to decide whether the
-- column is a number (entriesRepo.ts). It becomes `ORDER BY value_num NULLS
-- LAST, lower(value_text)` on an indexed join.
--
-- `value_num` and `value_date` are populated ON WRITE when the answer parses as
-- one, and left NULL when it does not, which is what makes the sort indexable:
-- the decision happens once, when the entry is stored, rather than on every
-- read of every row.
--
-- ── `idx` ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- A checkbox group or a multiselect is several answers to one question. `idx` is
-- which one, so the primary key can stay (entry, field, answer) and a
-- multiselect does not need a second table or a delimiter nobody can type.
-- Single-value answers are always idx 0.
--
-- ── The files ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- A file answer is currently a STRING with JSON inside it —
-- `file::{"key":…,"name":…,"size":…}` (FILE_PREFIX, src/lib/forms.ts) — encoded
-- that way so `answers` could stay a flat map of strings and every existing
-- reader kept working. It is a sound trick and it has one real cost:
-- `deleteForm` loads every entry's whole answers blob and runs a `JSON.parse`
-- per value purely to harvest the S3 keys it has to delete. With a table it is
-- one indexed select, and the keys cannot be missed because a file is no longer
-- disguised as text.
--
-- The attachment itself stays where it is — under ENTRY_PREFIX in the bucket,
-- private, reachable only through the authenticated route that streams it. This
-- table holds the key, never the bytes.
--
-- Expand only: `form_entries.answers` stays until phase 4 stops reading it.
-- With no rows in either table that is a formality here, but the discipline is
-- the same one every migration in this phase follows.
